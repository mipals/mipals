### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am currently PostDoc at the Section for Scientific Computing at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Previously I was a PhD student in the Acoustic Technology Group (ACT) as well as The Centre for Acoustic-Mechanical Micro Systems (CAMM) at DTU. Before this I studied computational science and engineering with an emphasis on optimization methods and numerical analysis.

Things I deal with on a regular basis
* Boundary Integral Equations (using the Boundary Element Method, the Fast Multipole Method, and $\mathcal{H}$-matrices).
* Structured linear algebra (specifically rank structure and sparsity).
* Optimization algorithms (mostly interior point methods for conic optimization).
* Scientific Machine Learning
