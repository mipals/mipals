### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a PhD student at The Technical University of Denmark working in the field of numerical acoustics. 

Things I deal with on a regular basis
* Boundary Integral equations (and their solution through the Boundary Element Method).
* Structured linear algebra (specifically rank-structure).
* Optimization algorithms (anything goes).
