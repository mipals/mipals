### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently a PhD student in the Acoustic Technology Group (ACT) as well as The Centre for Acoustic-Mechanical Micro Systems (CAMM) at The Technical University of Denmark. Before this I studied computational science and engineering with an emphasis on optimization methods and numerical analysis. I particularly took an interest in rank structured approaches which lead me down the path of studying Boundary Integral Equations applied to acoustics.

Things I deal with on a regular basis
* Boundary Integral Equations (and their solution through the Boundary Element Method).
* Structured linear algebra (specifically rank structure).
* Optimization algorithms (anything goes).
