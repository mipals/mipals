### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am currently doing a 1-year PostDoc at the Section for Scientific Computing at the Technical University of Denmark. Here I look into efficient implementations of interior-point methods for a certain applications in civil engineering. Previously I was a PhD student in the Acoustic Technology Group (ACT) as well as The Centre for Acoustic-Mechanical Micro Systems (CAMM). Before this I studied computational science and engineering with an emphasis on optimization methods and numerical analysis. In particular I took an interest in rank structured approaches which lead me down the path of studying Boundary Integral Equations applied to acoustics.

Things I deal with on a regular basis
* Boundary Integral Equations (and their solution through the Boundary Element Method using Fast Multipole Methods and $\mathcal{H}$-matrices).
* Structured linear algebra (specifically rank structure and sparsity).
* Optimization algorithms (mostly interior point methods).
